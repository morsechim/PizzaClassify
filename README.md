# Pizza Classification üçï

Welcome to the **Pizza Classification** project! This project utilizes a YOLOv8 model from [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to classify different types of pizzas from uploaded images. The application is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), making it easy to interact with the model via a web interface.
